# Lesson 1: Drawing Lines

## Learning Objectives
- Execute forward and backward motion, and the shorthands of these
- Use basic customization

## Turtle Basics
In Turtle, we can command the cursor to move around to create visual drawings like shapes. The code below instructs the drawing of a line using the command `forward`.

```python
import turtle

s = turtle.getscreen()
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.forward(10)

t.done()
```

The code above moves the cursor forward 10 pixels. Similarly, the command `backward` can move the cursor back 10 pixels.

```python
t.backward(10)
```

Both functions also have shorthand versions `t.fd()` and `t.bk()`, which work in the same way.

The initial angle of the cursor is set to `0` by default. We can change this by using the function `t.setheading()`. For example, the angle can be set to 45 degrees, as shown below.

```python
t.setheading(45)
```

The next functions we will learn about are `t.penup()` and `t.pendown()`. As the function names show, `t.penup()` means the pen is up, so the cursor will not draw anything. When then `t.pendown()` function is used, the cursor will resume drawing.

```python
t.forward(10)
t.penup()
t.backward(10) # this line will not be drawn
t.pendown()
t.forward(10)
```

## Customization
Here are some functions we can use to customize the Turtle screen.

Background color: `t.bgcolor("red")` will change the screen's background color to red. We can also try using "green" or "blue".

Screen title: `t.title("Intro to Turtle")` will change the screen title to "Intro to Turtle", as seen in the top of the window.

Cursor icon: We can change the cursor icon too, using the function `t.shape("turtle")`. There are other options as well, including "arrow", "circle", "square", "triangle", and "classic" (default arrowhead). To hide the cursor, use `t.hideturtle()`.

Cursor size: Finally, we can customize the cursor itself using `t.shapesize()`. `t.shapesize()` takes in 3 parameters: stretch width, stretch length, and outline (e.g. `t.shapesize(1, 5, 10)`).

## Review
Note: Assume we have imported the Turtle module as `t`.
